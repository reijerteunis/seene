/**
 * The trade record's tables, as one list the tests and the later tickets read.
 *
 * The migrations under `supabase/migrations/` create the tables; this is the
 * TypeScript side of the same fact, so a test asserts against one list rather
 * than against a second copy of the names. The list grew with each migration:
 * the thirteen tables of the tenancy, orders and settlement migration, the eleven
 * of the findings, claims and agent migration, and the five of the commerce and
 * billing migration, which is twenty-nine in all.
 *
 * `schema.test.ts` reads it in both directions. Every name here must exist in the
 * public schema, and every table in the public schema must carry `tenant_id`, an
 * enabled row-level security policy and the one tenancy expression, whether or
 * not it is named here: the catalogue is the authority, so a table added later
 * without tenancy fails the test without anyone remembering to extend it.
